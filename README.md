     In order to understand One of those parameters include understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above. The questions have been provided later in the document for which you can use tableau.

2. Build a regression model that predicts the housing price

    The first goal of this project is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset.

## 2. Data

The data set consists of information on some 22,000 properties.  The dataset consisted of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015. These are the definitions of data points provided: (Note: For some of the variables that are self explanatory, no definition has been provided)
